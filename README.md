## Description

[Locust](https://locust.io/) is a distributed and scalable open-source library that lets you do effective load testing in pure Python. This repository demonstrates a modular architecture to establish a template for quickly building a scalable stress testing pipeline using Locust.

## Locust Terminology

If you're unfamiliar with the terminologies and the generic workflow of writing stress-tests with Locust, it's highly encouraged that you go through the official [documentation](https://docs.locust.io/en/stable/) first.

**Task:** In Locust, a [Task](https://docs.locust.io/en/stable/writing-a-locustfile.html#tasks) is the smallest unit of a test suite. Usually, it means, any function or method that is decorated with the `@task` decorator.

**TaskSet:** A [TaskSet](https://docs.locust.io/en/stable/writing-a-locustfile.html#taskset-class) is a class that establishes a contextual boundary between different groups of Tasks. You can essentially group multiple similar Tasks inside a TaskSet. Then you use the TaskSets from your User class.

**User:** In Locust, a [User](https://docs.locust.io/en/stable/writing-a-locustfile.html#user-class) is a class that executes the tests either by directly calling the Task methods or via using TaskSets.

***In more complex cases, the tests can further be organized by arranging them in multiple test modules. This template groups the Tasks using TaskSets and places multiple TaskSets in separate test modules to ensure modularity and better scalability.***

## Target API

This template uses [Rapid API's](https://rapidapi.com/) currency-exchange [API](https://rapidapi.com/fyhao/api/currency-exchange) for showcasing the load testing procedure. The API converts one currency to another using the current exchange rate.

### API Anatomy

It takes three parameters in its query string —
```
1. q    : str - quantity
2. from : str - currency to convert from
3. to   : str - currency to convert to
```

And returns the converted value.


### Access the API

Sign up for a Rapid API [account](https://rapidapi.com/signup) and get your token. You can access the API via cURL like (You need to provide your API token in the header):

```bash
curl --request GET \
         --url 'https://currency-exchange.p.rapidapi.com/exchange?q=1.0&from=USD&to=BDT' \
         --header 'x-rapidapi-host: currency-exchange.p.rapidapi.com' \
         --header 'x-rapidapi-key: your-api-token'
```

The response will look like this:

```
84.91925⏎
```

Or, you might want to access it via Python. You can do so using the [HTTPx](https://github.com/encode/httpx) library like this:


```python
import httpx

url = "https://currency-exchange.p.rapidapi.com/exchange"

querystring = {"q": "1.0", "from": "USD", "to": "BDT"}

headers = {
    "x-rapidapi-host": "currency-exchange.p.rapidapi.com",
    "x-rapidapi-key": "your-api-token",
}

with httpx.Client() as client:
    response = client.get(url, headers=headers, params=querystring)

print(response.text)
```

## Stress Testing Pipeline

Below, you can see the core architecture of the test pipeline. For brevity's sake — files regarding containerization, deployment, and dependency management have been omitted.

```
.
├── commons             # Common elements required by the test modules
│   ├── auth.py         # Auth, login, logout etc
│   └── settings.py     # Read the environment variables here
├── locustfiles         # Primary folder where the tests live
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── bdt_convert.py  # Test module 1
│   ├── rs_convert.py   # Test module 2
│   └── locustfile.py   # Locust entrypoint
└── locust.conf         # Locust configuration file
```

The test suite has three primary components —
`commons`, `locustfiles` and the `locust.conf` file.

### [commons](./commons/)
The common elements required for testing, like `login` and `logout` functions reside in the **`commons`** directory. Here, all the common elements are arranged in the `auth.py` module.

### [locustfiles](./locustfiles/)
The actual test modules reside in the **`locustfiles`** directory. Test modules import and use the elements that reside in the `commons` directory.

The test suite consists of three modules — `bdt_convert.py`, `rs_convert.py`, and `locustfile.py`. The first two are the test modules and the third one acts as the entrypoint that Locust uses to spin up a server and run the tests.

* [**`bdt_convert.py`**](./locustfiles/bdt_convert.py/): This module houses a single TaskSet named `BDTConvert` that has two Tasks — `usd_to_bdt` and `bdt_to_usd`. The first Task tests the exchange API when the request query asks for USD to BDT conversion and the second Task tests the API while doing BDT to USD conversion.

* [**`rs_convert.py`**](./locustfiles/rs_convert.py/): The second test module is exactly the same as the first one; only it tests the API while the request query asks for USD to RS conversion and vice versa.

    The reason that there are two similar test modules is just to demonstrate how you can organize your Tasks, TaskSets, and test modules.

* [**`locustfile.py`**](): This file imports the TaskSets from the `bdt_convert` and `usd_convert` modules, and creates a [HttpUser](https://docs.locust.io/en/stable/writing-a-locustfile.html#making-http-requests) that will execute the tasks.

### [locust.conf](./locust.conf/)

The **`locust.conf`** file defines the configurations like *hostname*, *number* of *workers*, *number of simulated users*, *spawn rate*, etc.


## Run the Stress Tests Locally

* Make sure you've [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose) installed on your machine.

* Clone this repository and go to the root directory.

* Place your rapidAPI token in the `.env` file.

* Run:

    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x scripts/run.sh
    ./scripts/run.sh
    ```

    This will spin up a master container and a single worker container that will do the testing. If you want to deploy more workers to do the load testing then run:

    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x scripts/run.sh
    ./scripts/run.sh -n 4 # number of the workers
    ```

* To access the Locust GUI, go to [http://localhost:8089/](http://localhost:8089/) on your browser. You'll be prompted to provide a username and a password. Use `ubuntu` as the username and `debian` as the password. You'll be greeted by a screen like below. You should see that the fields of the form are already filled in since Locust pulls the values from the `locust.conf` file:

* Once you've pressed the *start swarming* button, you'll be taken to the following page:

* You can start, stop and control your tests from there.


## Disclaimer
This dockerized application is production-ready. However, you shouldn't expose your environment file (.env) in production. Here, it was done only for demonstration purposes.
